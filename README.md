# JavaScript and DOM Manipulation

* Using the UFO dataset provided [UFO Sightings Data](StarterCode/static/js/data.js), I wrote a code that appends a table to your web page and then adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting.

* Used a date form in a HTML document and a JavaScript code that will listen for events and search through the `date/time` column to find rows that match user input.
